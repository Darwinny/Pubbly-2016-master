Good question me,

This is a place to store any old code we scrapped but may reuse in the future.

Why not just comment it out?

Because HTML comments will close the intended comment, case and point

<!-- Commented out
    <div>
        <-- The image file here is a blah blah blah -->
        <img>
    </div>
--> No longer closes the HTML, it was already closed by the comment INSIDE the html.

Also, cleanliness.

If you want to scrap some old code, stick it here. Give is a very VERY specific name 
and make sure to leave a note on the line where it was removed. That way if you go 
looking again, you can just follow the bread crumbs. Also helpful if you add a comment 
at the top of the reusable file notating where you scrapped it from (from index.html, 
from chainLoader.js, etc)
